About
-----

PHP\_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding
standard. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. It can also help
prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.

Requirements
------------

PHP\_CodeSniffer requires PHP version 5.1.2 or greater, although individual sniffs may have additional requirements such
as external applications and scripts. See
the [Configuration Options manual page](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-codesniffer.config-options.php)
for a list of these requirements.

The SVN pre-commit hook requires PHP version 5.2.4 or greater due to its use of the vertical whitespace character.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install PHP\_CodeSniffer is to use the PEAR installer. This will make the `phpcs` command immediately
available for use. To install PHP\_CodeSniffer using the PEAR installer, first ensure you
have [installed PEAR](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php) and then run the following command:

    pear install PHP_CodeSniffer

If you prefer using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) you can easily install PHP_CodeSniffer system-wide with the
following command:

    composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"

Make sure you have `~/.composer/vendor/bin/` in your PATH.

Or alternatively, include a dependency for `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` in your `composer.json` file. For example:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": "1.*"
        }
    }

You will then be able to run PHP_CodeSniffer from the vendor bin directory:

    ./vendor/bin/phpcs -h

You can also download the PHP\_CodeSniffer source and run the `phpcs` command directly from the GIT checkout:

    git clone git://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git
